# RegressionModelFoodInsecurity

This project aims to develop a prediction model using US food insecurity data (FANO,
2023) based on the demographic and racial composition of people in different regions. The
aim of the project is to analyze the impact of the composition of racial factors (e.g., food
insecurity rate among white, black people, etc.) and demographic factors (food insecurity

rate among older people, younger people, etc.) on the amount of money needed by a food-
insecure person to meet weekly food needs. Using county-level aggregated data, we focus

on developing a prediction model to estimate the monetary value for required food. The
ultimate goal of this project is to provide decision-makers with a model that can be used to
determine how much food to distribute in a region with a particular composition of racial
and demographic characteristics. The result will help hunger relief organizations to ensure
